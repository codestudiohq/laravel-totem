# Introduction

> `Laravel Totem` is in its `Alpha` state. Its still a work in progress. Please proceed with caution and on your own risk.

Manage your `Laravel Schedule` from a pretty dashboard. Schedule your `Laravel Console Commands` to your liking. Enable/Disable scheduled tasks on the fly without going back to your code again.

## Documentation

#### Installation

`Totem` requires Laravel v5.4 and above. Use composer to install totem to your Laravel project

```
composer require studio/laravel-totem
```

> Laravel Totem supports auto package discovery for Laravel v5.5, therefore service provider registration is not required in Laravel v5.5

Add `TotemServiceProvider` to the `providers` array of your Laravel v5.4 application's config/app.php

```php
Studio\Totem\Providers\TotemServiceProvider::class,
```

Once `Laravel Totem` is installed & registered, 

- Run the migration

```
php artisan migrate
```

- Publish `Totem` assets to your public folder using the following command

```    
php artisan totem:assets
```

#### Configuration

##### Cron Job

This package assumes that you have a good understanding of [Laravel's Task Scheduling](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/scheduling) and [Laravel Console Commands](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/artisan#writing-commands). Before any of this works please make sure you have a cron running as follows:

```
* * * * * php /path-to-your-project/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

##### Web Dashboard 

`Laravel Totem`'s  dashboard is inspired by `Laravel Horizon`. Just like Horizon you can configure authentication to `Totem`'s dashboard. Add the following to the boot method of your AppServiceProvider or wherever you might seem fit.   

```php
use Studio\Totem\Totem;

Totem::auth(function($request) {
    // return true / false . For e.g.
    return Auth::check();
});
```

By default Totem's dashboard only works in local environment. To view the dashboard point your browser to /totem of your app. For e.g. laravel.dev/totem.

#### Making Commands available in `Laravel Totem`

All artisan commands can be scheduled. If you want to hide a command from Totem make sure you have the `hidden` attribute set to true in your command. For e.g.

```php
protected $hidden = true;
```

##### Use one of the following options if you are registering your commands in app/Console/Kernel in L5.4 and below 

- Option 1 : Create a array variable, let's say `$artisanCommands` in your app/Providers/AppServiceProvider and list all your commands just like you would do in app/Console/Kernel class. Now in the register method add the following

```
$this->commands($this->artisanCommands);
```

- Option 2: Roll your own ConsoleServiceProvider in app/Providers, create a array variable, let's say `$artisanCommands` and list all your commands just like you would do in app/Console/Kernel class. Now in its register method add the following. Don't forget to add this new provider to config/app.php's providers array.

```
$this->commands($this->artisanCommands);
```

From L5.5 onwards all commands are auto registered, so this wouldn't be a problem.
